## ABSTRACT

An increased pattern of hidden Internet of Things (IoT) devices has been observed. Due to the increased number of security attacks, a large number of IoT devices are disappearing from the public internet. Operating blockchain operations in such ad hoc connectivity becomes challenging. However, multiple past studies have pointed towards IOTA Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) that closely caters to offline blockchain use cases. However, there has been little to no empirical study or introduction to time bounds on transaction confirmation. Therefore, this study explains what provisions the existing IOTA blockchain has to accommodate the increased pattern of hidden IoT devices, and if IOTA is truly sufficient as a solution. In summary, we approach research questions by analyzing the studies that explore the trend of offline IoT devices and evaluating the relevance of offline blockchains, assessing the IOTA specification and codebase around offline transaction-making capabilities and pointing out some bounds that IOTA blockchain nodes must follow towards incoming transactions. Furthermore, we confirm by experimental runs that outside and within the tight time bounds transactions in offline Tangle can become stale and not get confirmed, and the effective time-bound can be even less. Realizing the need for a better offline blockchain scalability solution.
