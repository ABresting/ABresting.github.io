## ABSTRACT

The search engine Shodan crawls the Internet for,
among other things, Industrial Control Systems (ICS). ICS are
devices used to operate and automate industrial processes. Due
to the increasing popularity of the Internet, these devices are
getting more and more connected to the Internet. These devices
will, if not hidden, be shown on Shodan. This study uses Shodan,
together with data found by other researches to plot the trends
of these ICS devices. The studied trends focus on the country
percentage distribution and the usage of ICS protocols. The
results show that all studied countries, except the United States,
have decreased their percentage of world total ICS devices. We
suspect that this does not represent the real story, as companies
are getting better at hiding their devices from online crawlers.
Our results also show that the usage of old ICS protocols is
increasing. One of the explanations is that industrial devices,
running old communication protocols, are increasingly getting
connected to the Internet.
In addition to the trend study, we evaluate Shodan by
studying the time it takes for Shodan to index one of our
devices on several networks. We also study ways of avoiding
detection by Shodan and show that, by using a method called
port knocking, it is relatively easy for a device to hide from
Shodan, but remain accessible for legitimate users.
